    Parameters
    ----------
    input : str
      Specify a string or filename containing Fortran code.    
    isfree, isstrict : {None, bool}
      Specify input Fortran format. The values are determined from the
      input. If that fails then isfree=True and isstrict=False is assumed.
    include_dirs : {None, list}
      Specify a list of include directories. The default list (when
      include_dirs=None) contains the current working directory and
      the directory of ``filename``.

    Notes
    -----
    If ``input`` is a C filename then the functions searches for comment
    lines starting with ``/*f2py`` and reads following lines as PYF file
    content until a line ``*/`` is found.
