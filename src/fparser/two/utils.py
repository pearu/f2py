# A list of supported extensions to the standard(s)

# An X edit descriptor in a format statement specifies the position
# (forward from the current position) at which the next character will
# be transmitted to or from a record. In standard Fortran2003 the X
# edit descriptor must be preceeded by an integer which specifies how
# far forward from the current position. The 'x-format' extension
# allows the X edit descriptor to be specified without a preceeding
# integer.
EXTENSIONS = ["x-format"]

# Cray pointers are a well known extension to the Fortran
# standard. See http://pubs.cray.com/content/S-3901/8.6/
# cray-fortran-reference-manual-s-3901-86/types or
# https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gfortran/Cray-pointers.html for
# example. If 'cray-pointer' is specified in EXTENSIONS then this
# extension is allowed in fparser.
EXTENSIONS += ["cray-pointer"]

# A Hollerith constant is a way of specifying a string as a sequence
# of characters preceded by the string length and separated by an 'H'
# e.g. 5Hhello. See
# https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gfortran/Hollerith-constants-support.html,
# for example for more details. fparser currently supports Hollerith
# constants specified in format statements when 'hollerith' is specified
# in the EXTENSIONS list.
EXTENSIONS += ["hollerith"]

# Many compilers support the use of '$' in a fortran write statement
# to indicate that the carriage return should be suppressed. This is
# an extension to the Fortran standard and is supported by fparser if
# 'dollar-descriptor' is specified in the EXTENSIONS list.
EXTENSIONS += ["dollar-descriptor"]

        The pattern can be a regular expression, a string, a list or a
        tuple. If the input pattern is a regular expression or a
        string, a direct equivalence is performed. If the input pattern is a
        list or a tuple, then all of the contents of the list
        or tuple are searched for a match (by recursing). The list or tuple may
        contain regular expressions, strings, lists or tuples. This
