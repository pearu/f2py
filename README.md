# Introduction #

This project is based upon the Fortran (77..2003) parser originally
developed by Pearu Peterson for the F2PY project,
[www.f2py.com](http://www.f2py.com). It provides a parser for Fortran
source code implemented purely in Python.

# Obtaining #

fparser is available from the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fparser).
It may also be cloned from [github](https://github.com/stfc/fparser). Alternatively, github provides
tarballs for each of the [releases](https://github.com/stfc/fparser/releases).

# Documentation #

The documentation for fparser is hosted on [ReadTheDocs](http://fparser.readthedocs.io).
