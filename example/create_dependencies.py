'''This file contains an fparser script that parses Fortran files
and output the dependencies between these files suiteable for a Makefile.

It assumes that the module name in the use statement corresponds to the
name of the file (adding one of .F90/.f90/.x90). Only files in the current
directory will be tested, so external dependencies will not be listed.

Usage:  create_dependencies.py  file1.f90 file2.F90 ...
